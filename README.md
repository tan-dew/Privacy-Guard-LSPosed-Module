# Privacy Guard (LSPosed Module)

**Protect your apps from unwanted capture.**

---

## ðŸ”’ What It Does

When enabled for an app, Privacy Guard will:

1. **Block screenshots** â€” taking a screenshot shows a black/empty image or an error.
2. **Block screen recording** â€” recordings show a black area instead of app content.
3. **Hide app content in Recents** â€” the preview in the recent apps screen is blurred or blank.

Combine this module with any app locker of your choice if you want both **screen capture protection + app locking** for maximum privacy.
